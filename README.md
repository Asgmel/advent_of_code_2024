# Advent of Code 2024

This is my solutions to Advent of Code 2024 using Go.

You can find the tasks on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com).

## Runbook

To run the code you need to add a folder called inputs and add your inputs there as "day_xx.txt", e.g. day_01.txt.
You can then run the code by running the command <To be added later>.
